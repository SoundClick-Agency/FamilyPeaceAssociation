The reality is that it requires both the omnipotence of God and humans that are needed to be instruments of change. Each of us in FPA is equipped in unique ways to operate on different levels. One thing that has been made abundantly clear to me is we can limit our achievement by presupposing what our levels are. I would dare say that none of us knows our true potential.  Even God may not know that for each of us. I think what he has made clear; he is prepared to support us to achieve higher and higher levels of achievement especially if he can multiply those levels through others that we can inspire. The following, however, gives us some indication of his position \u2013<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>\u201cI tell you the truth, anyone who believes in me will do the same works I have done, and even greater works\u2026\u201d John 14:12 <a href=%22#_edn4%22>%914%93<\/a><\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>In conclusion, let us believe that there are no limits to what each of us can achieve if we have a mind to \u201cDream Big\u201d and be determined that in partnership with our Heavenly Father the possibilities to realize that and even bigger dreams are endless.
